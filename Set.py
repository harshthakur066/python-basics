# set is a collection of unique objects
# set is like dictionary dosn't support indexinx
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 5, 5}  # will only print one 5 (has to be unique objects)
my_set.add(10)
my_set.add(2)  # won't add
print(my_set)
print(1 in my_set)
print()

num = [1, 2, 4, 5, 5]
print(num)
print(set(num))  # to return unique values from the list


# sets have methods same like Van Diagrams in maths
